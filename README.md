# Interactive fiction typography

Much interactive fiction (AKA text-based games) nowadays is web-based, created with web oriented tools like [Twine](http://twinery.org). This page is a personal list of some resources I have found to potentially use in interactive fiction to **improve typography and create text effects.**
